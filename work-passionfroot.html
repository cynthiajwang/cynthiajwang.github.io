        <p class="padding-24">I grew tremendously as a designer and had the amazing opportunity to work in both marketing and product, areas I had expressed interest in during my interviews. I could not have asked for a better first internship.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p class="medium strong">
              Develop a stronger design sense and proceed with reason.
            </p>
            <p class="padding-16">
              Having had my first exposure to product design, I gained an immense amount of knowledge from working closely with our product designer on a few projects. But being in constant back-and-forth communication with my co-workers, I learned to be much more intentional about my design choices and always have a rationale to back up my decisions.
            </p>

              Working in a fast-paced environment.
            </p>
            <p class="padding-16">
              I learned what it was like to work at a startup and how the product cycle works by being a part of multiple product feature launches during my 8-week internship. Working in a fast-paced environment, I learned to effectively pace myself in order to deliver on time and be more comfortable sacrificing perfectionism for punctuality.

              Appreciating the iterative design process.
            </p>
            <p class="padding-16">
              Whenever tasked with a project, I'd make over 10 iterations of a design before getting them reviewed to make sure I experimented enough and explored as many possibilities as I could. In the beginning, I felt frustrated whenever I had to constantly go back and redo my designs. Looking back on my work and comparing my final designs to my first, I'd always feel grateful for all the steps I had to take to get to the end result.
            </p>

              Don't treat brand guidelines as stagnant.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having to reference the same brand guidelines every day, I became very familiar with our design principles. However, towards the middle of the internship, I began to feel limited by the guidelines and decided to proceed forward with new styles and icons. Although I often was advised not explicitly mentioned in the guidelines, I advocated for myself and created more interesting designs with my new ideas that still aligned with our guiding principles, just not as strictly.
